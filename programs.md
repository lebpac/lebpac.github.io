Our goal for the 2023/2024 school year is to build out the schedule to offer a broad range of activities for the kids in fitness, arts, and STEM. If there are any specific programs you’d like to see at the school please let us know!

These programs are not school sanctioned nor supervised by L'École Bilingue staff. The instructors rent school space from the VSB Rentals Department and are fully responsible for the supervision of the students.
