The easiest way to donate is through SchoolCash Online.

While it is much faster and easier to use SchoolCash Online, we are able to accept donations by cheque. Please make it out to *L'Ã‰cole Bilingue PAC* and leave it in the PAC mailbox in the office. If you would like a tax receipt, please include a note with your contact details.
