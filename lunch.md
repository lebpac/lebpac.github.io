Sushi Tuesdays and Pizza Thursdays are back for the 2023–24 school year!

Sushi and pizza lunches are run by grade 7 and grade 4 parents, respectively, to raise money for special events and Camp Sasamat.

We need volunteers to distribute lunch! If you're able to help, even occasionally, we'd really appreciate it. You can [sign up to volunteer here]({% link volunteer.md %}).

## How to order

Lunch orders are placed through MunchaLunch.

Orders for the _entire session_ must be placed before the session starts. Subscribe to the [mailing list]({% link mailing-list.md %}) for ordering dates and reminders.

{% include link.html link=munchalunch_link text="🥪 Place your lunch order through MunchaLunch" %}

Please note cutlery is not provided; ensure your child brings their own if needed.
