[Foodie Kids](https://www.foodiekids.ca){:target="_blank"} is a favourite at other schools with a menu that includes pasta, burgers, salads, sides, and more. We're offering a curated selection from their menu this term.

We need volunteers to distribute lunch! If you're able to help, even occasionally, we'd really appreciate it. You can [sign up to volunteer here]({% link volunteer.md %}).

## Order lunch

All lunch orders are placed through MunchaLunch.

{% capture munchalunch_link %}{% link munchalunch.html %}{% endcapture %}
{% include link.html link=munchalunch_link text="🥪 Place your lunch order through MunchaLunch" %}

### Good to know

- You'll be asked to choose one repeating order for each menu for the term and can make adjustments week-by-week
- Orders for each week can be changed or cancelled before they close
- Orders close **Thursdays at 7:00 am** for the following week
- Cutlery is not provided; ensure your child brings their own if needed

Let the lunchtime fun begin!
