[Foodie Kids](https://www.foodiekids.ca){:target="_blank"} is a favourite at other schools with a menu that includes pasta, burgers, salads, sides, and more. We're offering a curated selection from their menu this term.

We need volunteers to distribute lunch! If you're able to help, even occasionally, we'd really appreciate it. You can [sign up to volunteer here]({% link volunteer.md %}).

### Ordering tips

- You'll be asked to choose one repeating order for each menu for the term and can make adjustments week-by-week
- Orders for each week can be changed or cancelled before they close
- Orders close every **Thursday at 7 am** for the following week

## FAQ

**What if my child is away on lunch day?**  
If your child is absent, their order may be given to others to avoid waste. If you’d like to pick it up, you can do so at **12 pm in the multipurpose room**. Due to Food Safe regulations, we will not be able to store it for pick up later in the day.

**What if I want to change my child's order?**  
The ordering deadline for the following week is every **Thursday at 7 am**. For example, if you would like to change your child's lunch for Wednesday, January 28, the new order would need to be in MunchaLunch by Thursday, January 22 at 6:59 am. The change can be made by clicking on the "Edit" button next to your order. After a change, you may need to make a payment or use your available MunchaLunch credit (which will be held until your next order).

**Can we make specific requests to remove condiments/toppings etc.?**  
Unfortunately, the vendors do not have the capacity to manage individual requests from our families.
