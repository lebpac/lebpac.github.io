Sushi and pizza lunches are back for the 2024‚Äì25 school year!

Sushi and pizza lunches are run by Grade 7 and Grade 4 parents, respectively, to raise money for Grade 7 trips and Camp Sasamat.

We need volunteers to distribute lunch! If you're able to help, even occasionally, we'd really appreciate it. You can [sign up to volunteer here]({% link volunteer.md %}).

## How to order

Lunch orders are placed through MunchaLunch.

Orders are for the _entire session_ and must be placed before the session starts. The current session runs from September 26th to December 19th. Since this is a fundraiser, there are no refunds for missed dates. Please check your calendar and confirm your order with your child before ordering.

{% capture munchalunch_link %}{% link munchalunch.html %}{% endcapture %}
{% include link.html link=munchalunch_link text="ü•™ Place your lunch order through MunchaLunch" %}

Please note cutlery is not provided; ensure your child brings their own if needed.
