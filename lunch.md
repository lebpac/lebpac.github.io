Ordering is now open for **Winter 2026** with returning favourites and an exciting new Wednesday lunch option!

- 🍣 Tuesdays — Minato Sushi (starts January 6)
- 🍔 Wednesdays — Foodie Kids ⭐️ _NEW!_ (starts January 14)
- 🍕 Thursdays — Panago Pizza (starts January 8)

[Foodie Kids](https://www.foodiekids.ca){:target="_blank"} is a favourite at other schools with a menu that includes pasta, burgers, salads, sides, and more. We will only be offering a selection from their full menu this term.

## How to order

All lunch orders are placed through MunchaLunch.

{% capture munchalunch_link %}{% link munchalunch.html %}{% endcapture %}
{% include link.html link=munchalunch_link text="🥪 Place your lunch order through MunchaLunch" %}

### Ordering tips

- You'll be asked to choose one repeating order for each menu for the term and can make adjustments week-by-week
- Orders for each week can be changed or cancelled before they close
- Orders close **Thursdays at 7:00 am** for the following week
- Cutlery is not provided; ensure your child brings their own if needed

We need volunteers to distribute lunch! If you're able to help, even occasionally, we'd really appreciate it. You can [sign up to volunteer here]({% link volunteer.md %}).
