Sushi (Tuesdays) and pizza (Thursdays) are back for the fall term! Ordering is now open. Pizza starts Thursday, Sept 25 and sushi starts Tuesday, Oct 7.

We need volunteers to distribute lunch! If you're able to help, even occasionally, we'd really appreciate it. You can [sign up to volunteer here]({% link volunteer.md %}).

## How to order

All lunch orders are placed through MunchaLunch.

{% capture munchalunch_link %}{% link munchalunch.html %}{% endcapture %}
{% include link.html link=munchalunch_link text="ü•™ Place your lunch order through MunchaLunch" %}

Please note cutlery is not provided; ensure your child brings their own if needed.

### New for this school year

- MunchaLunch will be _open_ to place, change, or cancel orders throughout the entire term.
- Each lunch day's orders will _close_ **five days before**; for example, for the pizza lunch on Oct 9, ordering will close at 11:59 pm on Oct 4.
- During your initial purchase, you will be asked to choose one repeating order for your child for the term. If your child changes their mind, adjustments can be made anytime before that order closes.
