Sushi and pizza lunches are run by grade 7 and grade 4 parents, respectively, to raise money for special events and Camp Sasamat.

**🍕 Pizza Lunch is open for ordering on [MunchaLunch]({% link munchalunch.html %}) now through to September 22nd at midnight! This session runs from September 26th until December 19th.**

Thank you for supporting our PAC fundraisers and a special shout out to the parent volunteers who have signed up to help with pizza lunch this year.

<!-- We need volunteers to distribute lunch! If you're able to help, even occasionally, we'd really appreciate it. You can [sign up to volunteer here]({% link volunteer.md %}).
