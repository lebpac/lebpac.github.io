Sushi and pizza lunches are run by Grade 7 and Grade 4 parents, respectively, to raise money for Grade 7 Grad and Camp Sasamat.

We need volunteers to distribute lunch! If you're able to help, even occasionally, we'd really appreciate it. You can [sign up to volunteer here]({% link volunteer.md %}).

## How to order

Lunch orders are placed through MunchaLunch.

{% capture munchalunch_link %}{% link munchalunch.html %}{% endcapture %}
{% include link.html link=munchalunch_link text="ü•™ Place your lunch order through MunchaLunch" %}

Orders are for an _entire session_ and must be placed before the session starts. Subscribe to the [newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}) to stay informed about ordering dates.

Since this is a fundraiser, there are no refunds for missed dates. Please check your calendar and confirm your order with your child before ordering.

Please note cutlery is not provided; ensure your child brings their own if needed.
