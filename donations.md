title: Direct Donation
---

Most of our funds are raised through direct donation, an annual voluntary contribution. The suggested amount is **$100 per child**. This allows us to significantly reduce the number of small fundraisers and retain only those that are efficient and contribute to our community. The more funds we receive through direct donation, the less we will need to solicit donations from parents throughout the year.

## Donate!

The easiest way to donate is through SchoolCash Online.

{% capture donate_link %}{% link donate.html %}{% endcapture %}
{% include link.html link=donate_link text="ðŸ’³ Donate through SchoolCash Online" %}

While it is much faster and easier to use SchoolCash Online, we are able to accept donations by cheque. Please make it out to *L'Ã‰cole Bilingue PAC* and leave it in the PAC mailbox in the office. If you would like a tax receipt, please include a note with your contact details.
