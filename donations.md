title: Direct Donation
---

Public funds cover basic education at L'Ã‰cole Bilingue, but as parents and guardians we directly fund additional valuable education resources beyond those normally provided by the VSB and government. Most of our funds are received directly from our parent families and raised through countless volunteer hours and dedicated efforts on programs like the pizza and sushi lunch.

## Where do the funds go?

As outlined in our annual PAC Budget, funds raised are targeted in a number of ways including investments in:

* Arts and Cultural Programs for the entire school (author visits/performances)
* Sports equipment, fitness programs (like new jerseys for our school teams)
* Science workshops
* Building up our technological resources (tablets/laptops)
* Supplementing classroom learning resources (like books and supplies)
* Camp Sasamat (keeping the camp affordable)
* School growth and other programs and initiatives like EarthBites

## Why direct donation?

Direct donation is an annual, voluntary, confidential contribution with a suggested amount per child ($100) that allows us to significantly reduce the number of small fundraisers undertaken and retain only those that are efficient and significant in return for the hours invested as well as those that contribute to our community. The more funds we receive through direct donation the less we will have to fundraise to support programs and the fewer donation solicitations parents will receive throughout the year.

Direct donation is also a great way for parents to contribute to school activities who are unable to make time for volunteering during the school day.
