Our annual Halloween Haunt is happening on **Thursday, October 23, from 5 to 7 pm**! Get ready for a _spooktacular_ evening of fun and frights for the whole family.

{% include link.html link=munchalunch_link text="🎟️ Purchase tickets through MunchaLunch" %}

## We need your help

To make this event a haunting success, we’re officially looking for volunteers!

All available roles are listed on the sign-up sheet. We’re especially looking to fill the zone lead positions  as soon as possible, as some may require prep ahead of time.

Thank you in advance for helping us create a memorable night for our school community. We couldn’t do it without you!

## Prize table donations — let's recycle the joy!

Do you have gently-used toys or stuffed animals at home that aren’t getting much playtime? This year, as a great way to give these treasures a second life, we’re inviting families to help stock the prize table by donating any less-frequently used items that are in good condition.

| Drop-off | Monday, October 20 |
| Location | Under the table outside the front office|

Thank you for helping us create a fun and sustainable prize table experience!

## Musical cake donations

We’ll also be collecting baked goodies for our beloved Musical Cakes game. Cakes, cookies, bars, tarts, confections—sweet or simple, homemade or store-bought, all treats are welcome!

Please avoid nuts and items that require refrigeration (everything will be kept at room temperature until the evening). If your item is allergy-friendly (e.g., gluten, lactose, or egg-free), please label it clearly.

| Drop-off | Thursday, October 23, anytime before 4 pm |
| Location | Table outside the office|
{: .borderless-table}

No time to bake? Store-bought treats are _fantastic_ and especially helpful for those with ingredient concerns!
