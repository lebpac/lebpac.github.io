Our annual Halloween Haunt is happening on **Thursday, October 23, from 5 to 7 pm**! Get ready for a _spooktacular_ evening of fun and frights for the whole family.

## We need your help

To make this event a haunting success, we’re officially looking for volunteers!

All available roles are listed on the sign-up sheet. We’re especially looking to fill the team lead positions by the end of next week so they can attend the prep and inventory meeting at the school on October 14.

Parents from all grades are warmly invited to join in any area that interests them. That said, we’re particularly hoping to find Kindergarten or Grade 1 parents to help lead the Little Games Room—an area tailored to our youngest students, where your insight and support would be especially valuable.
