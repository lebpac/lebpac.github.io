<h1>Direct Donation</h1>

<p>Public funds cover basic education at L’&Eacute;cole Bilingue, but as parents
and guardians we directly fund additional valuable education resources beyond
those normally provided by the VSB and government. Most of our funds are
received directly from our parent families and raised through countless
volunteer hours and dedicated efforts on programs like the Pizza and Sushi
Lunch.</p>

<h2>Where do the funds go?</h2>

As outlined in our annual PAC Budget, funds raised are targeted in a number of
ways including investments in:

<ol>
  <li>Arts and Cultural Programs for the entire school (Author visits/performances)</li>
  <li>Sports equipment, fitness programs (e.g. new jerseys for our school teams)</li>
  <li>Science workshops</li>
  <li>Building up our technological resources (tablets/laptops)</li>
  <li>Supplementing classroom learning resources (books and supplies etc.)</li>
  <li>Camp Sasamat (keeping the camp affordable)</li>
  <li>School Growth and other programs and initiatives like EarthBites</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why Direct Donation</h2>

<p>Direct Donation is an annual, voluntary, confidential contribution with a
suggested amount per child ($100) that allows us to significantly reduce the
number of small fundraisers undertaken and retain only those that are efficient
and significant in return for the hours invested as well as those that
contribute to our community. The more funds we receive through Direct Donation
the less we will have to fundraise to support programs and the fewer donation
solicitations parents will receive throughout the year.</p>

<p>Direct donation is also a great way for parents to contribute to school
activities who are unable to make time for volunteering during the school
day.</p>

<h2>Donate!</h2>

The easiest way is through SchoolCashOnline. We've outlined instructions
below.</p>

<h3>Using SchoolCashOnline</h3>

<p>The VSB has gone to online payments, including direct donations for PACs.</p>

<p>Hopefully you already have an account at <a
  href="https://vsb.schoolcashonline.com/">SchoolCashOnline</a>. This is the
same account as you use to pay school fees, etc. If you haven’t set it up yet,
it is very easy.</p>

<p>If you need to set up a new account click “Register”.</p>

<img src="register.png">

<p>Then follow the instructions to register.</p>

<h4>Once you have an account set up</h4>

<p>Whether you registered a new account, or are using an existing account, sign
in now.</p>

<p>In the top right, choose "Items".</p>

<img src="items.png">

<p>Then, click on "Make A Donation".</p>

<img src="make-a-donation.png">

<p>Then, scroll down, select the amount you want to donate. <b>Be sure to select "E-L'Ecole Bilingue PAC" otherwise the PAC will not receive your donation</b>.

<p>Once you’ve entered your payment information and paid, you will receive a tax
receipt from the VSB delivered to your email.</p>

<p>The generosity of the L’Ecole Bilingue parent community, both in direct
donations and volunteering of their time, are truly unmatched. Thank you all for
your consideration and care of our school and children.</p>

<h3>By Cheque</h3>

<p>While it is much faster and easier to use SchoolCashOnline, we are able to
accept donations by cheque again this year. You can leave a cheque in the PAC
mailbox in the office, made out to "L'Ecole Bilingue PAC". We will need to get
in touch to collect name and various contact information in order to provide
this information to the school board so that they can issue the tax receipt.</p>
