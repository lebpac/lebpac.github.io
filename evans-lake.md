Especially if you're a family that's joining us in Kindergarten, we'd like to encourage you to consider joining us on September Labour Day weekend at [Evans Lake](https://evanslake.com/). It's a great way to get to know parents in the community. Having your Kindergarteners have some new best friends from camp the weekend before school starts makes for a much easier first week as well. More information and sign up at [lebevanslake.com](http://www.lebevanslake.com).
