Come join other L'√âcole Bilingue families for our annual Family Camp at [Evans Lake](https://evanslake.com/){:target="_blank"} over the Labour Day long weekend!

## About the Camp

Families of students who attend L'√âcole Bilingue have been privately organizing a camping trip over the Labour Day long weekend for almost 40 years. It's a great opportunity to get to know other families while enjoying the outdoors. This is not a school or PAC sponsored event.

School-age children (those entering grade one through grade seven) stay in cabins with counsellors. Parents and small children (children entering kindergarten in September, or younger) camp in tents and vans on a grassy field by the lake. All meals are prepared by Evans Lake staff. The camp is participatory with parents assisting with some duties.

This year's camp takes place **Labour Day weekend, September 3‚Äì5**. Plan to arrive by 3 pm on Saturday and stay until Monday around 2 pm.

## Cost

$205 per person (entering K and older; younger kids free).
