Come join other L'√âcole Bilingue families for our annual Family Camp at [Evans Lake](https://evanslake.com/){:target="_blank"} over the Labour Day long weekend!

This year's camp takes place **Labour Day weekend, August 31‚ÄìSeptember 2, 2024**. Plan to arrive by 10 am on Saturday (programming will start promptly!) and stay until Monday around 11 am.

This timing is about 5 hours earlier than previous years so folks can avoid traffic and get home earlier the night before school starts.

## About the camp

Families of students who attend L'√âcole Bilingue have been privately organizing a camping trip over the Labour Day long weekend for almost 40 years. It's a great opportunity to get to know other families while enjoying the outdoors.

School-age children (those entering kindergarten through grade seven) stay in cabins with counsellors. Parents and small children (children entering kindergarten‚Äîif they prefer, or younger) camp in tents or stay in a limited number of bunk rooms in the lodge. All meals are prepared by Evans Lake staff. The camp is participatory with parents assisting with some duties.

## Cost

$275 per person (entering K and older; younger kids free). This is a $25 increase from last year as Evans Lake increased their fees. It's an additional $5 per day for special diets (lactose intolerant, gluten-free, vegan, allergies); no cost for vegetarian or nut allergies.

If camp cost is a hardship, please [let us know](mailto:lebevanslake@gmail.com).
