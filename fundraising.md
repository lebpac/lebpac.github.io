As parents and guardians, we directly fund additional educational resources beyond those provided by the VSB and provincial government.

## Direct donation

Most of our funds are raised through direct donation, an annual voluntary contribution. The suggested amount is **$100 per child**. This allows us to significantly reduce the number of small fundraisers and retain only those that are efficient and contribute to our community. All donations are eligible for an income tax receipt.

If anyone (family, friends, neighbours, grandparents, etc.) goes to COBS Bread at 8th and Cambie (across from Whole Foods) and mentions Lâ€™Ã‰cole Bilingue when they pay, 5% of their purchase will be donated to the school!

## Where do the funds go?

As outlined in our annual PAC Budget, funds are used in a variety of ways:

* Arts and cultural programs (author visits/performances)
* Sports equipment, fitness programs (like new jerseys for our school teams)
* Science workshops
* Technology resources (tablets/laptops)
* Supplementing classroom learning resources (like books and supplies)
* Camp Sasamat (keeping the camp affordable)
* School growth and other initiatives like EarthBites
