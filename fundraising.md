As parents and guardians, we directly fund additional educational resources beyond those provided by the VSB and provincial government.

## Donate

Most of our funds are raised through direct donation, an annual voluntary contribution. The suggested donation amount is **$100 per student**.

> Having the opportunity to use the video projector and the whiteboard has helped increase students’ engagement during phonology activities in my classroom — by having students being able to come use dry erase markers directly on the board to highlight sounds in our words, texts, songs lyrics. It makes it all more fun to learn how to read and write. <span class="attribution">— Grade 1 teacher</span>

> Being able to project items directly onto a whiteboard has dramatically enhanced my lessons and my students' learning. It has enabled me to facilitate explicit modelling of concepts during lessons by annotating diagrams or completing examples together. Thank you so much for providing us with such a useful tool! <span class="attribution">— Grade 7 teacher</span>
