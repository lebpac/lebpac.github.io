As parents and guardians, we directly fund additional educational resources beyond those provided by the VSB and provincial government.

## Direct donation

Most of our funds are raised through direct donation, an annual voluntary contribution. The suggested amount is **$100 per child**.

All donations are eligible for a tax receipt.

## Where do the funds go?

Make a donation today to help enhance your child's school experience. Your direct donation funds much needed programs and resources, including:

* Technology resources (tablets/laptops/smart boards)
* Sports equipment, fitness programs
* Arts and cultural programs (author visits/performances)
* Science workshops
* Supplementing classroom learning resources (like books and supplies)
* Grade specific events and programs

Your generosity directly impacts our students, teachers, and community. No amount is too small—every dollar makes a difference!
