## FAQ

**If I purchase books from my teacher's wish list, will they get delivered to my child?**\
Yes, all books that you've purchased will be packaged and delivered to your child at school a week or two after the book fair closes. Once received, you or your child can gift the books directly to the teacher.

**Will the books come fully packaged or will my child be able to see the books when delivered to their class?**\
Your order will be individually wrapped or boxed and the books will not be visible at delivery, so it's safe for gifts!

**What if my teacher does not have any titles on their list?**\
If you'd like to support your teacher, you can ask them if there's any specific genres they'd like or ask your child to pick what they think the class may enjoy.

**Any other questions?**\
