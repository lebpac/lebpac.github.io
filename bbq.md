Welcome back, L’École Bilingue Families!

Mark your calendars—the much-anticipated Welcome Back BBQ is happening on **Thursday, September 18th, from 5–8 pm** following _Meet the Teacher_.

This annual event is both an important **fundraiser for our Grade 7 graduating class** and a wonderful opportunity to come together as a community, and ALL are welcome!

## ✨ This year’s highlights

- CultivATE Food Truck: burgers, veggie burgers, hot dogs, mac & cheese
- DJ Kyprios spinning the tunes
- Rain or Shine Ice Cream Truck
- Face painting & photo booth
- Musical cakes
- Snack table
- Movie room
- Game stations led by our Grade 7 grads
- The always-popular _Swifty Station_

Most importantly, the BBQ is a chance to **welcome new families and staff** and to **reconnect with old friends** as we kick off the school year together.

## 🎟️ Tickets and food

Ticket and food truck orders will open soon through MunchaLunch.

All food truck orders must be made in advance by **Sunday, September 14**! There will be **no food truck orders at the event**.
