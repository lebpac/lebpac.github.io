**The hot lunch program will be back soon! Join the [mailing list]({% link mailing-list.md %}) for updates.**

Lunches are ordered ahead of time. Ordering and payment is done through MunchaLunch. If you're new to the school, you can [sign up for a MunchaLunch account here](https://munchalunch.com/schools/leb/).

The lunch programs are administered by parent volunteers. You can contact the sushi coordinator at [sushi@lebpac.ca](mailto:sushi@lebpac.ca) and pizza coordinator at [pizza@lebpac.ca](mailto:pizza@lebpac.ca).
