Come join other L'École Bilingue families for our annual Family Camp at [Evans Lake](https://evanslake.com/){:target="_blank"} over the Labour Day long weekend!

## About the camp

Families of students who attend L'École Bilingue have been privately organizing a camping trip over the Labour Day long weekend for almost 40 years. It's a great opportunity to get to know other families while enjoying the outdoors.

School-age children (those entering kindergarten through grade seven) stay in cabins with counsellors. Parents and small children (children entering kindergarten—if they prefer, or younger) camp in tents or stay in a limited number of bunk rooms in the lodge. All meals are prepared by Evans Lake staff. The camp is participatory with parents assisting with some duties.

This year's camp takes place **Labour Day weekend, August 31–September 2, 2024**. Plan to arrive by 10 am on Saturday and stay until Monday around 2 pm.

## Cost

Last year, the camp cost $250 per person (entering K and older; younger kids free). Rates for this year will be confirmed soon.
