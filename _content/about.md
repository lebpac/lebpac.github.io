We're a friendly team of volunteers who work with the admin and teachers to improve school life and educational opportunities for our kids.

We host fun events like the Welcome Back BBQ and Halloween Haunt; organize [extracurricular programs]({% link programs.md %}) like art, tennis, and musical theatre; coordinate courses like Red Cross Babysitting and First Aid; invite speakers and guests to share their knowledge; and run a [lunch program]({% link lunch.md %}) to give parents a break from making lunch!

We encourage you to [get involved]({% link volunteer.md %}) wherever you are able. It makes for a much richer school experience for both you and your children.
