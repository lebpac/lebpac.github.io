We're a friendly team of volunteers who work with the admin and teachers to improve school life and educational opportunities for our kids.

We run fun **events** like the Welcome Back BBQ and Hallowe'en Haunt. We organize **after-school programs** like art, tennis, and musical theatre. We coordinate **courses** like Red Cross Babysitting and First Aid. We invite interesting **speakers and guests** to share their knowledge. We have a **[lunch program]({% link lunch.md %})** to fundraise and give parents a break from making lunch!

We encourage you to get involved wherever you are able. It makes for a much richer school experience for both you and your children.
