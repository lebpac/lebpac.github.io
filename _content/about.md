We're a friendly team of volunteers who work with the admin and teachers to improve school life and educational opportunities for our kids.

We also host fun events like the Welcome Back BBQ and Hallowe'en Haunt; organize [after-school programs]({% link programs.md %}) like art, tennis, and musical theatre; coordinate courses like Red Cross Babysitting and First Aid; invite interesting speakers and guests to share their knowledge; and run a [lunch program]({% link lunch.md %}) to fundraise and give parents a break from making lunch!

We encourage you to get involved wherever you are able. It makes for a much richer school experience for both you and your children.
